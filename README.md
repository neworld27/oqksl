# OSS-Final Project
This is a Remote Ordering Service From School's Snack bar or Restaurant in order to pick up the food right away.
Using PhP, mysql, html, the ordering page is shown and when the customer selects the menu
1. Write Your Ordering "NickName"
2. School Id (To prevent No Show)
3. Select the Menu
4. Write down the time to Pick up if you want.
5. Order 

What does this project do and why is it helpful? 
 = In the School cafeteria, there are no reservation service. Students who are in a great hurry just want to get their food right away, finish them right away. However, Due to the highly increasing line in cafeteria, students give up. To increase the rotation rate of the food, this project might help some.
